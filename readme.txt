Adds collapse/expand links to menu items to de-clutter the nav menu interface

== Description ==

Menu Tamer adds collapse/expand links to nav menu items in the WordPress admin interface. If you have a large navigation menu, managing it can become a frustrating task due to the sheer size it takes up. Menu Tamer lets you collapse any branch of a nav menu to get it out of the way.

Menu Tamer has been tested in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, as well as Internet Explorer 7, 8, and 9 (understandably, it is much slower in IE, but it works).
