Menu Tamer
===

Menu Tamer adds collapse/expand links to nav menu items in the WordPress admin interface. If you have a large navigation menu, managing it can become a frustrating task due to the sheer size it takes up. Menu Tamer lets you collapse any branch of a nav menu to get it out of the way.

Browser Support
---

Menu Tamer has been tested in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox (all on OS X), as well as Internet Explorer 7, 8, and 9 (understandably, it is much slower in IE, but it works).

Installation
---

Install via the WordPress plugin installer and activate. You're done.
